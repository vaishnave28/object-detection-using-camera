# Object Detection Using Camera

## Overview

This is a real-time object detection project using a laptop camera. The system detects objects in the video stream, identifies their names, and displays the confidence percentage for each detected object. The project uses Python with OpenCV and YOLOv8 (Ultralytics).

## Features

* Real-time object detection using a webcam
* Displays object name and confidence percentage
* Lightweight and optimized for standard laptops

## Tools and Libraries Used

* Python 3.11.7
* OpenCV
* Ultralytics YOLOv8 (pretrained model)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install opencv-python ultralytics
```

## How to Run

1. Save the Python script (`object_detection.py`) on your laptop.
2. Open Command Prompt or terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python object_detection.py
```

4. Your webcam will open, detecting objects in real-time.
5. Press **q** to exit.

## Outcome

* Detects multiple objects from live webcam feed
* Displays object name and confidence percentage
* Runs smoothly on standard laptops
